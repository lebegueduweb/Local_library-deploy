# Local_library-deploy
...Deploy in process
This is the first version of my django module. The module contains 3 apps

- Local library: A simple app for managing libraries. Users can borrow, add, return, delete book and/or author. Oauth set and permissions are based on users groups .The apps allow to share real books and librarians, and have informations about others users. This object model can be extended to any other objects (cars, articles and so on...)

- Portfolio containing 2 apps. A job app allowing to directly display works on the user template sheet and a blog like any other blog which can be used to post any of our ideas with media support

Pull requests and plugin welcome :)
